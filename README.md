# California Housing Prices Dataset 🔥

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the California Housing Prices dataset, which was used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow*. This dataset serves as an excellent resource for learning and implementing machine learning algorithms. It requires basic data preprocessing, contains intuitive variables, and is of a manageable size.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset includes information about housing in various districts of California based on the 1990 census. While it does not reflect current housing prices like Zillow Zestimate, it is widely used for educational purposes to understand machine learning workflows.

### 📁 Data Fields
The dataset consists of the following features:
- **longitude**: Geographical coordinate (longitude)
- **latitude**: Geographical coordinate (latitude)
- **housing_median_age**: Median age of the houses in the district
- **total_rooms**: Total number of rooms in all houses of the district
- **total_bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms in all houses of the district
- **population**: Population of the district
- **households**: Number of households in the district
- **median_income**: Median income of households in the district
- **median_house_value**: Median house value in the district
- **ocean_proximity**: Proximity of the district to the ocean

⚠️ **Note**: The dataset requires preprocessing as it contains missing values and raw data.

## 🚀 Usage
This dataset is widely used for:
- Regression tasks
- Data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and preprocessing exercises
- Model evaluation and performance comparison

## 🔧 Preprocessing Steps
To prepare the dataset for machine learning models, the following preprocessing steps are recommended:
1. Handle missing values (e.g., impute missing values in `total_bedrooms`).
2. Convert categorical values (e.g., `ocean_proximity`) into numerical features.
3. Scale numerical features for better model performance.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## 📜 License
This dataset is available for public use and is commonly used in educational machine learning projects.
